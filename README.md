# Data_Projects
Here are some side and course projects I have completed throughout my journey!

StatisticalLearningInUniversityData compares Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Principle Component Analysis, and Partial Least Squares for the optimal model that predicts the number of Applications received from various universities. I find the necessary predictors/number of components using dimension reduction and penalized least squares methods, as well as using cross-validation to find parameter values. 

Lab14 computes type I and type II errors with Monte Carlo simulations and calculates confidence intervals for hypothesis testing using a sample of oranges from a grove.

Lab11 displays the convergence of confidence intervals in the difference of means problem.

Project3 shows the process of choosing an optimal linear model for concrete. We use materials in concrete as predictors and the compressive strength of the sample (in MPa) as the dependent variable.

Stats3303FinalProj goes through the process of proposing a Bayesian hierarchical model in American Football. We observe the probability of successfully making a kick as a function of distance.

Isomap_and_Eigenfaces reproduces the ISOMAP algorithm from Tenenbaum et al. (2000) on a dataset of 698 face images, each represented as a 64×64 vector (R4096). You implement ISOMAP yourself using Euclidean distances and shortest-path computation, tuning the ε parameter to achieve meaningful results.

clustering contains Python implementations of clustering algorithms applied to both images and network data. It includes a custom K-Means algorithm for image compression and a spectral clustering approach for political blogs, along with scripts for loading data, performing clustering, and evaluating results.

Airline_Time_Series_Model folder contains an analysis of United Airlines baggage complaints from 2004–2010. It uses exploratory data analysis, detrending and deseasonalizing, and evaluates multiple ARMA/ARIMA model candidates to forecast future complaints, ultimately selecting an ARMA(1,2) model for prediction with corresponding confidence intervals
